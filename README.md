# BioChem

Free library for biochemical modeling and simulation with Modelica.

## Library description

The design idea behind the `BioChem` library is to create a general purpose Modelica library
for modeling, simulation and visualization of biological and biochemical systems.
The classes implemented in the BioChem library describe substances and reactions that can
take place in-between these substances in a diverse number of biochemical pathways.
