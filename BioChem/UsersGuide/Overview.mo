The classes implemented in the BioChem library describe substances and reactions that can take place in-between these substances in a diverse number of biochemical pathways.</p><br><img src=\"modelica://BioChem/Resources/Images/Library.png\">&nbsp;Packages in the library&nbsp;<br><h2>Library Structure</h2><p>Since the design objective for&nbsp;<em>BioChem</em>&nbsp;was to provide properties and attributes that are common in biological and biochemical systems the library contains several packages holding classes and partial models. The classes can be used as they are in sub libraries to&nbsp;<em>BioChem</em>, while the partial models must be further extended to fully functional models.</p></body></html>"));
