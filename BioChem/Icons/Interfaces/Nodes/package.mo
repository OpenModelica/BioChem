 <p>
 This package contains connection points used in the <b>BioChem</b> package.<br>
The reaction between two or more substances is described by the molar flow rate between the involved substances. The molar flow rate is typically expressed as a function of the concentration or amount of substance. Therefore the interface or nodes contain not only the molar flow rate and concentration, but also the volume, in order to make it possible to calculate the amount of substance if needed. <br>
The interfaces in the  library are all identical except for the graphics, and the volume variable V. The different graphics are used to indicate if respective substance should be seen as substrate, product, modifier, etc., in a reaction. The variable V  is an output variable in the

<a href=\"Modelica://BioChem.Interfaces.Nodes.SubstanceConnector\">SubstanceConnector</a>


 and an input variable in all the other nodes.
The variables available in each connection point are described below:
